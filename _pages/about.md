Research
========

In general, my research interests lie in the realm of efficient algorithms for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Specifically, my focus is directed towards parallel hp-adaptive finite element methods, which offer the flexibility to dynamically define both the local grid resolution and the polynomial degree of the function space for spatial discretization. My overarching goal is to provide a general formulation of these methods in ready-to-use and extensively documented open-source software.

At present, my research is centered around the development of a robust solver tailored for hp-adaptive discretizations, especially in complex geometries. Looking ahead, I aim to apply these methods to solve time-dependent problems, expanding the horizons of their applicability and impact.


Software
========

I consider myself both a software engineer and a computatational scientist, driven by the pursuit of elegant and universal solutions to complex problems. My approach involves crafting simple yet comprehensive solutions and providing extensive documentation to ensure accessibility and usability.

One of my significant roles is as a principal developer of the open-source library [deal.II](https://www.dealii.org/). This library serves as a valuable resource for creating customized finite element codes, empowering researchers and engineers to tackle a wide range of numerical challenges effectively.
